# calculator

You can never have enough calculators! This project lets you perform simple operations on a set of numbers. No need to drag your parents along for back-to-school shopping, because it's free! On top of the main goal of the project, extra functionality was given in the form of: keyboard input, decimals, sign switching for input, and backspace key character deletion.
